            <br><br>
            <h3>these are the major plot points of the bee movie</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Barry graduates: Barry B. Benson, a bee, graduates from college and is disappointed by the idea of working a <br> monotonous job making honey for the rest of his life.</li>
                <li>Barry joins pollen jocks: Barry joins the "Pollen Jocks," a group of bees that venture outside the hive to collect<br> pollen, allowing him to see the outside world.</li>
                <li>Barry meets Vanessa: While exploring New York City, Barry meets a human florist named Vanessa and breaks the bee law<br> by talking to her. They form a friendship.</li>
                <li>Barry learns about honey production: Barry discovers that humans are stealing honey from bees and selling it<br> commercially, which upsets him.</li>
                <li>Barry sues the human race: Barry files a lawsuit against humans for exploiting bees and stealing their honey.</li>
                <li>Court ruling: Barry wins the lawsuit, and humans are forced to stop taking honey from bees. As a result, the<br> bees stop working and producing honey.</li>
                <li>Environmental consequences: Without bees pollinating flowers, plants begin to die, and the environment suffers.</li>
                <li>Barry and Vanessa's plan: Realizing the damage, Barry and Vanessa hatch a plan to restart the bees' work by<br> helping them pollinate a special parade of flowers in Pasadena, California.</li>
                <li>Saving the environment: Barry and the bees successfully pollinate the flowers, bringing the environment back <br>to life.</li>
                <li>Barry’s new role: Barry finds a balance between his duties as a bee and working with humans, helping both the <br>bee community and the human world.</li>
            </ol>
